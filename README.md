# mdlive_connect_sdk_ios_demo

Note: The purpose of this sample app is to demonstrate how to initiate a video session through the MDLive Connect SDK.
As such, the code is kept concise to illustrate the code required (in production, you will want to add more error checking / reporting).

You will need to supply your own API key / secret / bearer token. You can request them from your MDLIVE resource if you do not have them).
Also, this code is to be built off on a device (not a simulator) as testing on a simulator is not recommended due to the lack of a simulated camera and microphone.
